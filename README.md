# Long Run Price or Basket Convergence?

This folder has the code files for the paper "Long Run Price or Basket Convergence?" by Fernando Borraz and Leandro Zipitr√≠a.
The original database has information of:

- an index of each store, product, time, city, and department (Uruguayan states)
- the median price for each triple (store/product/month)
- a count variable of the number of competition and brands for each triple


The order of files, and its explanation, is as follow:

1) 0.Bases.Convergence.R: run the regressions of the price database to filter the series and store the residuals. 

2) 1.CreateSDbase.R: estimate standard deviation and mode for price and residual series.

3) 2.Info.general.R: create the figures (can be safely skipped)

4) 3.Regressions.R: regressions of price (equation 1 of the Paper)

5) 4.RegressionSD.R: the main regressions of the paper (equation 2)
